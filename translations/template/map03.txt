4c=

# There is something buried in the center of this barrow.
4d=

# You dislodge the prize. This ring is adorned with many vile runes and a pearl carved to resemble a skull. Its power mesmerizes you -- almost. Sensing that you intend to destroy it, it transforms itself into an evil spirit and attacks!
4e=

# The ring spirit is destroyed. It retreats to its ring, but the ring itself has been splintered, and a west wind blows the spirit away. For a brief instant you are surrounded by smiling faces, but they too fade, content at last.
4f=
