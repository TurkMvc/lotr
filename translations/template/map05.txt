# Upon the bridge, the chieftain of the Black Riders, the Witch-King of Angmar, the Black Captain, known by a hundred accursed names, laughs at you. "This is Sauron's domain, as all places shall soon be Sauron's domain!" Then the vision fades.

79=

# You look at this stone figure with a great deal of pity. It speaks in a noble but pleading voice: "Wings! I must have wings!" it cries.
7a=

# The mud melts from its eyes, and the great eagle spreads its wings and gives a cry: "To you I give a gift. We eagles are the servants of one who will not abandon Middle Earth. When your need is uttermost, call upon Thorondor for deliverance."

# The water from the Mirror swirls and coalesces into strange shapes. Dark forces try to overwhelm the vision, but the power of Galadriel guides it, and against her there are few beings in Middle-earth of greater power. The image forms...
86=

87=

# ...and upon a throne, the lieutenant of Sauron, the Black Captain, the Witch-King of Angmar. Above him is the symbol of the Evil Eye. Beneath him, he has prisoners. The friends that were taken from you. The Ringbearer and his treasure...
