Install Instructions for "The Lord of the Rings"
================================================


* If You want to use demo data files, read "Installing the demo" bellow.

* If You want support for the CD version of the game read "CD version" bellow.

* If You want to compile The Two Towers read the file towers.txt




Instaling the full game:
------------------------

The simple way according to seven steps process(TM):

1) make sure you have installed necessary dependencies
   (Debian/Ubuntu package names in parentheses)

   - GNU toolchain (build-essential)
   - SDL (libsdl1.2-dev)
   - SDL_mixer (libsdl-mixer1.2-dev)
   - freepats (freepats), needed only for SW midi emulation

2) compile by typing
make

3) copy game data to /usr/local/share/games/lord/
or $HOME/.lord/

4) copy the game executable lord to /usr/local/bin/ or whatever

5) run by typing
lord

6) Optionally, if you have paragraph texts from the cd version
(file para.dat), copy them to /usr/local/share/games/lord/
this will show the full text of paragraphs during the game	

7) enjoy


It is worth to look into lord.h for some usefull definitions
(like screen scale factor, cheat mode, midi parameters, etc... )

Optionally You can edit Makefile to obtain more optimized code.



Installing the demo:
--------------------


1) You must define DEMO=1 in Makefile.

2) compile by
make clean; make

3) copy the compiled executable to directory where you have demo data.
cd to this directory, type 
./lord

Alternatively, You can copy the demo data to $HOME/.lord/ and the executable
lord anywhere to your path.


"make lorddemo" does not work at the moment

CD version
----------

In order to compile the support for CD version uncomment 
#define CD_VERSION
in lord.h

All data and .av movies must be copied to 
/usr/local/share/games/lord/cd/
(or other path defined in lord.h)
