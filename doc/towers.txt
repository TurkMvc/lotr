The Two Towers engine
=====================

Since version 0.5.5 there is an experimental support for The Two Towers.
Currently the sound does not work and the game is unplayable.

I do not plan to support TTT at the moment since I never really played
and liked the game. But it should not be that difficult to make it work -
so if You like the game it is up to You to make it work.


Compilation
===========

Uncomment the line
// #define TTT
in the file lord.h

Then compile the game exactly as described in INSTALL




Installation
============

The game data are stored in /usr/local/share/games/lord/towers/
by default.

I reccomend to copy the executable lord to /usr/local/bin/ (or whatever)
under the name towers
so 
cp lord /usr/local/bin/towers
will make it possible to have both vol. I and vol. II installed at one time.
